## About
### What is Simulated Research:
A simulated research process is a method used to mimic real-world research activities in a controlled, virtual, or experimental environment. This approach allows researchers to explore, understand, and predict outcomes without the constraints or ethical concerns of conducting actual research in real-life settings.

### Purpose of doing it:
- Allows for experimentation without risk to human subjects or the environment.
- Enables exploration of multiple scenarios and conditions.

### How do we do it:
- Clearly articulate the research question or hypothesis that the simulation aims to address.
- Conduct a thorough review of existing literature to understand the current state of knowledge and identify gaps that the simulation will aim to fill.
- Develop a detailed plan for how the research will be conducted.
- Create models that replicate the real-world system or phenomena being studied.
- Run the simulated process for data creation or collection.
- Ensure that the data collected is comprehensive and accurately reflects the simulated conditions.
- Analyze the data using statistical methods, computational techniques, or other analytical tools to draw insights and conclusions.
- Compare the simulated data with real-world data (if available) to validate the simulation model.
- nterpret the results in the context of the research question. Discuss the implications, potential limitations, and the extent to which the simulation provides insights into the real-world phenomenon.

### What is produced:
-  Document the entire process, from the design and execution of the simulation to the analysis and interpretation of results. Prepare reports, papers, or presentations to share findings with the scientific community or stakeholders.

## Research Projects
- [**Minimizing interference in personal decisions can enhance relationship satisfaction and strengthen bonds.**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/SR-H01-Interference-And-Relationship) : In this project, we are hypothesizing that less interference in personal matters can improve the bond in a personal relationship. We acknowledge that there are many other confounding elements in a relationship. However, this is one of the main components that can affect the relationship between two individuals.
